# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning project to detect Parkinson's Disease using biomedical voice measurements. The project uses supervised learning techniques to classify whether a patient has Parkinson's or not.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Samples**: 195 voice recordings  
- **Features**: 22 biomedical voice features (e.g., MDVP, DFA)  
- **Target**: Binary (Parkinson’s / Healthy)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Workflow

1. Load and explore dataset
2. Preprocess features and labels
3. Split dataset into training and test sets
4. Train a Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluate using accuracy and predictions

## 📈 Performance

- Train Accuracy: ~87%
- Test Accuracy: ~83%

> This model can be expanded using cross-validation and alternative classifiers like Random Forest or SVM for comparison.

## 🔬 Future Improvements

- Implement feature scaling and selection  
- Try different ML models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Add confusion matrix and ROC analysis  
- Integrate with a web app for real-time use
